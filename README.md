# Bellabeat Capstone Project - Fitbit Data Analysis

This project is a case study for Bellabeat, a high-tech company focusing on womenâ€™s health and wellness products. The analysis uses data from the publicly available **Fitbit Fitness Tracker** dataset on Kaggle to uncover trends in user behavior and provide actionable insights that Bellabeat can use to improve user engagement.

## Overview

The **Fitbit dataset** contains information about daily activity, sleep, and health metrics recorded by users of the Fitbit device. This analysis provides valuable insights into the physical activity levels and health metrics of users. Based on these findings, I provide strategic recommendations for Bellabeat to enhance their product offerings.

## Key Features of the Analysis

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepared and cleaned the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed patterns in user activity, sleep quality, and health metrics using R.
- **Activity and Sleep Analysis**: Explored key metrics such as steps taken, calories burned, total distance, and sleep duration.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, recommendations were made for Bellabeat to better personalize their offerings and encourage user engagement.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **R Programming**: Analysis was performed using R.
- **R Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `lubridate` for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Created meaningful visualizations to identify key insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the **Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data** available on Kaggle:

- [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

The dataset includes information such as daily step counts, calories burned, and sleep patterns of Fitbit users.

## Project Files

- `Bellabeat_Fitbit_Analysis.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing all steps of data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualizations.

## Key Insights

- Users who engage in more physical activity tend to burn more calories and show improved sleep quality.
- Sleep duration and sleep efficiency appear to be critical factors influencing overall health metrics.
- Recommendations include encouraging users to set personalized activity and sleep goals, which can foster a more engaged and healthier user base.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides Bellabeat with insights into how their users engage with fitness and health tracking. The recommendations aim to improve the user experience and increase product engagement by leveraging personalized health data.
